# Hey-Day-Script
Hey Day is one of Auburn University's longest and most cherished traditions. Initiated by the Student Government Association, Hey Day is a day when everyone wears name tags to promote unity, ensuring that everyone feels seen and heard."
To discover the origins and purpose of Hey Day, please visit the following http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/. This year, the Hey Day tradition is scheduled for October 18, 2023. In celebration of this occasion, I have created a shell script to wish my users a happy Hey Day."
>```ruby
> #!/bin/bash
>```
Prompt the user to enter their name
>```ruby
>         read -p "Kindly enter your name: " username
>```
Greet the user Hey day by putting Hey in front of their name
>```ruby
>          echo "Hey, $username!"
>```
